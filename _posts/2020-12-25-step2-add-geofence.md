**1. Create a .cub file**

You need a cub file which is used as skybox. Six side of the cubes should be provided by developer. They should be .png format. Additionally, you need to create a .cub file near these side images which consist a cub configuration file. Edit .cub file and write configurations according to side images properties. The images which are used in this codelab are 1024*1024 dimensions. So width and height is settled as 1024.

Configuration file: 

<div style="padding: 5px"><img style="width: 250.00px ; padding: 5px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsragngr/gh-pages-cgkitskyvisioncodelab/gh-pages/assets/cg6.png">
</div>

Folder which contains configuration file and side images.

(Name is must be the same as the following example)

<div style="padding: 5px"><img style="width: 500px ; padding: 5px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsragngr/gh-pages-cgkitskyvisioncodelab/gh-pages/assets/cg7.png">
</div>


This file should be in asset folder of project:

<div style="padding: 5px"><img style="width: 500px ; padding: 5px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsragngr/gh-pages-cgkitskyvisioncodelab/gh-pages/assets/cg8.png">
</div>

Additionally, a cube .obj file is needed. (You can download various cub files from websites).
