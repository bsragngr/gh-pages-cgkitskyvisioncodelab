**1. Create a .cub file**

You need a cub file which is used as skybox. Six side of the cubes should be provided by developer. They should be .png format. Additionally, you need to create a .cub file near these side images which consist a cub configuration file. Edit .cub file and write configurations according to side images properties. The images which are used in this codelab are 1024*1024 dimensions. So width and height is settled as 1024.

Configuration file: 

![](C:\Users\b00568925\Desktop\gh-pages-cgkitcodelab\assets\cg6.png)

Folder which contains configuration file and side images.

(Name is must be the same as the following example)

![](C:\Users\b00568925\Desktop\gh-pages-cgkitcodelab\assets\cg7.png)

This file should be in asset folder of project:

![](C:\Users\b00568925\Desktop\gh-pages-cgkitcodelab\assets\cg8.png)

Additionally, a cube .obj file is needed. (You can download various cub files from websites).
