**2. Creating Model**

You need to compose your own Scene object and model. In this project, we used a 3D blacksmith object. It has an also texture file which provides color on it. 

The textures of the object is:

<div style="padding: 5px"><img style="width: 250.00px ; padding: 5px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsragngr/gh-pages-cgkitskyvisioncodelab/gh-pages/assets/cg10.png">
</div>

Model and texture file are located in models folder which is under assets:

<div style="padding: 5px"><img style="width: 250.00px ; padding: 5px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsragngr/gh-pages-cgkitskyvisioncodelab/gh-pages/assets/cg11.png">
</div>
