## **Overview**

HUAWEI CG Rendering Framework is a high-performance rendering framework based on the Vulkan graphics API, consisting of the PBR material, model, texture, illumination, and component systems, and more. This framework is designed for Huawei DDK features and implementation details to provide the optimal 3D rendering capability of the Huawei platform. In addition, the framework supports secondary development, with reduced difficulty and increased efficiency.

To use CG Kit, you will need to do following: 

<ul class="checklist">
	<li>Register as a HUAWEI Developer and create an app in AppGallery Connect.</li>
    <li>Create a Native C++ project with Android Studio IDE, and configure the SDK on which HUAWEI ID depends.</li>
    <li>Implement HUAWEI ID API calls and debugging, by referring to the HUAWEI ID development guide.  </li>
</ul>


## **What you will create**

In this codelab, you will use the demo project to call the CG Kit APIs provided by Huawei. Through this demo project, you are going to: 

<ul class="checklist">
	<li>Load a Skybox</li>
    <li>Load an OBJ model</li>
    <li>Load a PNG texture.</li>
    <li>Try out the lighting effects of direction light and point light.</li>
    <li>Set object scale (zoom in and out) / rotate the object </li>
</ul>
